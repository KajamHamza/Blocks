# Blocks: Web3 Social Media App

## Progress

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- âœ… Created basic app structure with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- âœ… Implemented UI components using shadcn/ui library
- âœ… Set up basic routing with React Router
- âœ… Created landing page with wallet connection options
- âœ… Implemented profile setup flow
- âœ… Created feed, profile, and notification pages

### Phase 2: Lens Protocol Integration
- âœ… Set up Lens Protocol client configuration
- âœ… Created wallet connection services with MetaMask, Coinbase, and WalletConnect options
- âœ… Implemented profile checking and creation through Lens Protocol
- âœ… Updated API utilities to work with Lens Protocol types
- âœ… Fixed browser compatibility issues with Lens Protocol SDK
- ðŸ”„ Implementing real data fetching from Lens Protocol

## Current Status
We have implemented real wallet connection functionality with MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet (WalletConnect needs additional configuration). The authentication flow connects the user's wallet and checks if they have an existing Lens Protocol profile. If not, they are directed to create one.

We've also fixed browser compatibility issues with the Lens Protocol SDK by adding necessary polyfills for the global object.

## Next Steps

### Short-term:
1. Complete implementation of WalletConnect
2. Implement real profile creation through Lens Protocol's on-chain methods
3. Update feed to display real posts from Lens Protocol
4. Implement post creation that publishes to Lens Protocol

### Medium-term:
1. Implement social interactions (likes, comments, mirrors)
2. Add search and discovery features
3. Create user settings and profile management
4. Implement notifications system connected to Lens Protocol events

### Long-term:
1. Add community features
2. Implement token-gated content
3. Add analytics dashboard for creators
4. Integrate additional Web3 features (NFTs, tokens, etc.)

## Architecture

The app follows a component-based architecture with:
